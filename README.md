# Project Details
## How do I complete this project?
Review the Online Resume [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/145/view).

1. In this project I practice HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website!
2. Text Formatting: All text is formatted identically to the mockup. You should not use break tags for this project. You can create the desired separate with paragraph tags.
3. Image and Link: The imageâ€™s source is the correct URL and the link in the article is correct.
4. Reflections have four questions:
- What new skills have you learned?
- What has been easy?
- What has been difficult?
- How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

### By the end:
The project will look like this:

My repository includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the mockup to article page.
* **reflections.txt**: The reflections will include simple answers.
* **blog-mockup.pdf**: The pdf shows the mockup of the article.
* **README.md**:
